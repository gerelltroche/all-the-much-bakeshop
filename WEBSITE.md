# All the Much Bake Shop - Website Project

_A website for my wife's bakery business_

## Discovery Answers

### Business & Brand
1. **Story - Meet the Baker:**
   
   > Hello and welcome! I'm Katie, and I'm so excited to open the virtual doors to my dream, All the Much Bake Shop. I'm so happy to share a little bit about my cookie adventure with you!
   >
   > **My Baking Story:** My journey started as a little girl, acting as my grandma's official "sous chef" in her kitchen. She sparked my lifelong passion for creating delicious things from scratch.
   >
   > **The Name:** The heart of this bakery comes from a phrase my husband and I share: "love you all the much." It's our sweet, silly saying, and it's even engraved on my wedding band. I felt it was the perfect name to build the bake shop on love.
   >
   > **My Specialty:** With a passion for art, I fell in love with decorated cookies as my canvas! I've worked hard to create a recipe that tastes just as incredible as it looks. My goal is for you to never have to choose between a pretty cookie and a delicious one.
   >
   > **My Crew:** When I'm not covered in flour, you can find me with my amazing husband, Gerell, and our two sweet pups, Mud Puddle (the Shih Tzu) and Risa (the Standard Poodle). They are my favorite taste-testers and my whole heart.
   >
   > **What's Next:** My dream is to create edible art that adds a little extra sparkle to your celebration. From detailed custom sets for big events to fun seasonal drops just because. I'm just getting started and so excited to meet everyone and add All the Much to your event! It means the world to me that you are here with me on the ground floor as I start this new adventure. With your help we can build something incredible together!

## Video Consideration

### Should we add a "Meet the Baker" video?

**Developer Recommendation: Phase 2 (Nice to Have)**

**Pros:**
- More personal connection with customers - seeing Katie's personality and passion
- Can show the baking process/behind-the-scenes
- Video content is engaging and increases time on site
- Helps differentiate from competitors
- Shows the artistry and care that goes into each cookie
- Could show Mud Puddle and Risa (customers love pet content!)

**Cons/Considerations:**
- Production quality matters - low quality could hurt more than help
- Requires time investment to shoot and potentially edit
- May need video editing skills (or I can learn)
- Could slow page load if not optimized properly
- Not critical for MVP launch - the written content is warm and engaging

**If we do video, best practices:**
- Keep it short: 60-90 seconds max
- Shoot in good natural lighting (near a window)
- Use phone camera (newer phones are excellent)
- Show: Katie decorating cookies, talking about her passion, maybe the pups
- Authentic > polished - people want to see the real person
- Can use free tools like CapCut or iMovie for basic editing
- Host on YouTube or Vimeo and embed (don't host video files directly on site)

**Suggested Approach:**
1. **MVP Launch:** Use the written "Meet the Baker" content with photos
2. **Phase 1.5:** If Katie is comfortable, shoot a simple phone video
3. **Phase 2:** Add video to the About page once we have it

**Alternative for MVP:**
- Use a series of 3-4 candid photos instead:
  - Katie decorating cookies
  - The pups in the kitchen
  - Finished cookie creations
  - Katie holding a tray of cookies (warm, welcoming shot)

### Email/SMS Notification System
For order form notifications (US-017), I recommend:
- **Emailjs** (free tier) - Simple integration for sending emails from static sites
- **Formspree** (free/paid) - Form backend that can send to email/SMS
- **Twilio SendGrid** (free tier) - More robust email solution
- **Zapier** (connects form to email/SMS) - No-code option but requires subscription

### Email Collection & Newsletter
For email collection (US-023, US-033):
- **Mailchimp** (free up to 500 subscribers) - Industry standard, easy integration
- **ConvertKit** (free up to 300 subscribers) - Creator-focused
- **Buttondown** (free up to 100 subscribers) - Simple, markdown-based

### Future: Availability Calendar
For Phase 2 calendar (US-029):
- **Calendly** integration - Simple booking system
- **Google Calendar** API - Free, customizable
- **Tockify** - Calendar widget for websites

### Inventory Management
For Phase 2 inventory (US-035, US-036):
- **Airtable** - Flexible database with forms and API
- **Notion** - Similar to Airtable, good for small business
- **Google Sheets + API** - Free, fully customizable
